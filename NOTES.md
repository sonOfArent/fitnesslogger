# Fitness Logger

This is my second attempt at a fitness logger, although I don't believe it will be used by anyone. Ah well, it'll be a good project to finish anyway.

I am restarting because I want to incorporate React-Bootstrap, as well as Bootstrap, to help me streamline the process better.

## Basic Idea

As there will be at least three users, there is no reason not to implement some sort of register / login system. That is something I should be learning anyway. I will have registering happen through a modal. Thus, a register/login page is needed.

There should be a homescreen page that includes some basic statistics, such as how many exercises or how long one has exercised this week. Thus, a home page is needed.

There should be a profile page where one can view more detailed and mutable statistics, such as the sessions one has completed. This can open modals or the like, showing the exercises in the session. The idea is that one can go back and edit previous sessions in the event they are recorded incorrectly beforehand. Thus, a profile page is needed.

There should be a sessions page where one can also view this information, as well as create new sessions. One may view one of these sessions and create, update, or delete exercises pertaining to them. Thus, a sessions page is needed.

Finally (as far as I can think of), I may want some sort of leaderboard, being daily, weekly, or all time. I say may, because this may actually _discourage_ the use of the app. Above all, I want this app to help **encourage** exercise. Perhaps I can create such a thing, and ask how people feel about it afterwards.

## Necessary pages:

- Login / Register
- Homepage
- Profile
- Sessions
